WHAT IS BRUTEFORCE APPROACH?
-----------------------------

- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution
per given the constraints.

- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution,
either maximum or minimum.
◼ Ex:

WHAT IS BACKTRACKING?
----------------------

- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but in order to find ALL the possible solutions.
We are not looking for an optimum solution in this case.
◼ Ex: How two boys and a girl can be arranged in 3 chairs? 3!

- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.

- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function. In other words,
if a bounding function is found, then this path is invalid and we must return in aim to
keep working on the non explored paths.
◼ Ex: The girl can't sit in the middle.

- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.

- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.
