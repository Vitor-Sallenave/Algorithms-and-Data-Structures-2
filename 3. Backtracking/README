WHAT IS BACKTRACKING?
----------------------

- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but in order to find ALL the VALID solutions.
We are not looking for an optimum solution in this case.

◼ Ex: How two boys and a girl can be arranged in 3 chairs? 3!

- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.

- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function. In other words,
if a bounding function is found, then this path is invalid and we must return in aim to
keep working on the non explored paths.

◼ Ex: The girl can't sit in the middle.

- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
